### 🚀 About Me
I'm an aspiring **AI Engineer / Cloud Developer** passionate about building intelligent systems using:

- 🔹 Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- 🔹 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- 🔹 Cloud-based APIs  
- 🔹 Vector Databases  
- 🔹 Machine Learning & NLP  

I enjoy working on **practical AI projects**, optimizing pipelines, deploying APIs, and exploring ways to integrate LLMs into real-world applications.

### 🔥 Highlight Project – AmbedkarGPT  
**Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering System**

✔ Built a full RAG pipeline using LangChain 0.3+ (LCEL)  
✔ Used ChromaDB for vector storage and MiniLM-L6-v2 for embeddings  
✔ Integrated local LLM inference via Ollama (Mistral)  
✔ Designed CLI-based Q&A chatbot  
✔ Developed a complete evaluation framework (Assignment-02):  
   - Hit Rate, MRR, Precision@K  
   - ROUGE-L, BLEU, Semantic Similarity  
   - Chunk size benchmarking (Small/Medium/Large)  
✔ Fully offline setup, Python-only, no API keys required  
✔ Includes automated analysis report + JSON logs
